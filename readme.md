This is a template I use to skip having to manually add emotion & recoil to every next.js project I create.
Anyone is welcome to use it.
No support is provided.

If someone has a compelling reason to add/change this template, you may submit a pull request.
If you simply have a preference for a different dependency, please instead either fork the repo or create your own.

The template itself is available under the MIT license.
Please see the licenses of the dependencies for their respective licenses.
